<p><a href="https://kavanagh.digital/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/software-development-concept-programming-and-coding-vector-id1275744791?k=20&amp;m=1275744791&amp;s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;h=ehAE19lRMyfUG3ttfLAJZZ5quUbK2qn-1vehZuw8TrQ=" alt="" width="612" height="408" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today the Internet giant,&nbsp;<strong>Google</strong>, celebrates its birthday.&nbsp;To be more exact<strong>, he is already 18 years old</strong>.&nbsp;Wow, a real barbarity!&nbsp;Time in which he has managed to set trends in the digital marketing and web development sector.&nbsp;Even more, set the pace of work and define what needs to be done to gain visibility on the Internet.&nbsp;Today we dedicate this article to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google is a&nbsp;<strong>very useful tool for the user.&nbsp;</strong>But it is more for businesses,&nbsp;web development professionals, companies and freelancers who want to promote their website and attract customers when they rank in the first search results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the world's most famous giant and seeker&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;is a double-edged sword.&nbsp;</strong>Because if we do not anticipate their changes and updates in their algorithms, your page may be seriously affected in terms of positioning.&nbsp;Web development is a variable that directly affects this visibility.&nbsp;That's why choosing the right one for your business can be key.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Google: Make you gold or a lunge to death</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only concern that Google has is the user.&nbsp;This means that if the user does not like a feature of your website,&nbsp;<strong>Google will not like that feature</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;An example of this can be seen in that for January 10 of next year they are expected to maintain a very aggressive policy with pop-ups.&nbsp;As users, pop-ups are invasive, they make us lose focus on what we were seeing.&nbsp;And in many cases they even make us leave the web.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To appear in the first positions in the search engine,&nbsp;<strong>it will ask you for much more than a few good links</strong>.&nbsp;We are going to have to optimize the texts of the web, take care of the headers, the bold, the semantics, the legibility... The web design and the structuring of the contents is also key for Google.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it is that&nbsp;<strong>Google wants the user's law to be fulfilled.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;However, don't worry, Google gives web development professionals time to make the necessary changes to their websites.&nbsp;Of course, if you are a little clueless and ignore his warnings, he will punish you very harshly and it will be very difficult to recover.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The keys to SEO web development?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A web developer must always be aware of&nbsp;<strong>possible changes in the Google algorithm</strong>&nbsp;that may affect their website.&nbsp;Both at the layout level and at the level of visualization of the contents and structures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This has gone so far that some web development professionals&nbsp;<strong>have learned a solid foundation of SEO</strong>&nbsp;that will help them have a more global understanding of what Google is considering for websites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The visits that we are going to get from the search engine to our website from the search engine are 100% free.&nbsp;This is the so-called organic traffic.&nbsp;But remember that these types of visits are&nbsp;<strong>monitored by the search engine itself</strong>&nbsp;at all times.&nbsp;This tells us that you care about the user's response to our website.&nbsp;A good development and web design, focused on the user, will provide us with a good response from the user and that they remain on our website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It does this because&nbsp;<strong>Google doesn't like high bounce rate.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;What is that bounce rate?&nbsp;With this term we refer to when a user enters the web, he leaves immediately because he does not load, he does not like the design or simply because he is not interested in the search he has made in the search engine.&nbsp;This information tells Google that the website is not interesting for the user, so it will penalize the website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Some tips for your website</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is where the work of the web development and web page design expert who has to worry about improving the web stands out.&nbsp;Here are some of the factors you should consider:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Design a&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>perfect usability for mobile devices.&nbsp;</strong>Being adapted to smartphones and tablets affects positioning and search results</li>
<li>Make good use of colors.&nbsp;It is a question of design, but one that a web developer must keep in mind when building the web</li>
<li>Strengthen the security offered by the domain.&nbsp;For example, that your site has the SSL protocol, that is, go from HTTP to HTTPS</li>
<li>Increase the loading speed of the web.&nbsp;A factor considered not so important, but that visits from mobiles takes on crucial importance</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this so that the user is comfortable on your website and that Google knows through the data collected with its bots that your website is relevant and well developed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">So, is Google the bad guy in the movie?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But hey, the truth is that&nbsp;<strong>Google is not the bad guy.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;He doesn't want to sink you into the pit of the last few pages of his browser.&nbsp;<strong>Google is the best</strong>&nbsp;, it is the one that has allowed us the internet revolution.&nbsp;It is the one that turns the wheel of the web, although it gives a little more work to web developers and designers.&nbsp;It also&nbsp;offers tools to help web development&nbsp;.&nbsp;Also, remember that it is the one that brings you potential customers organically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get along with Google we have to 'fuck it'.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<strong>mediocre and unhelpful web design will be penalized and will disappear</strong>&nbsp;from the high results.&nbsp;On the contrary, if your website is adaptable to all types of devices, with a fast loading speed and easy navigation, together with a good link building strategy, it will ensure your good position in the Google search engine.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What do we have to do to have a quality website?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most important thing is&nbsp;<strong>to always have an</strong>&nbsp;experienced professional.&nbsp;Hiring a quality web development service is more necessary than ever.&nbsp;Web designers and professionals of web positioning and digital marketing will also be complementary to embark on the path to fall in love with Google.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If what you are looking for is to&nbsp;start a digital project&nbsp;, you will have to&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>look for a good web designer</strong>&nbsp;capable of developing a design and an adequate interaction for the user that Google protects.&nbsp;This way you will have visibility and conversions in the short and long term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google will do the rest.&nbsp;And it is that it is the search engine itself that marks the steps and the one that rules at the time of positioning websites.&nbsp;For this same reason&nbsp;<strong>, we must insist on trusting&nbsp;certified professionals&nbsp;.&nbsp;</strong>Experts who work with all the knowledge and skills for Google to position your website at the top of the search engine.</p>
